<h3>Section 3 - Checklist for timing with fsTimer</h3><br>

<b>One month before race day</b>
<ul>
<li>Get race bibs.
<li>If using a barcode scanner to enter bib IDs into fsTimer, get the barcode scanner and (if necessary) print barcode labels.
<li>Install fsTimer, read through the documentation, and spend time fiddling around in the software to familiarize yourself with it.
<li>Find people to help with day-of registration and for operating the finish line.
</ul>
In the next section we will give some tips on what types of bibs we find to be best, and about using a barcode scanner with fsTimer. We also give detailed descriptions of the jobs that will be done by the volunteers helping at the registration tables and at the finish line.<br><br>

<b>Two weeks before race day</b>
<ul>
<li>Have fsTimer installed on all of the computers to be used for registration, and of course, the computer to be used for the actual timing.
<li>Work with the race director to determine what the divisionals and registration database fields will be, and create a project in fsTimer for your race.
<li>If pre-registrations are being kept in a spreadsheet that will be imported into fsTimer, then obtain the current state of pre-registrations and try importing it into fsTimer, to make sure that everything is formatted correctly and will work as you want.
</ul>

<b>The week before the race</b>
<ul>
<li>Train the people working the registration table on what to do and how to use fsTimer to do it.
<li>Train the people working the finish line on what their roles will be, and do a practice run simulating the whole finish line process.
<li>When pre-registration is closed (perhaps the day before the race), import all of the pre-registration results into fsTimer (either importing it as a spreadsheet in the Preregistration window, or by just entering it all in at the Registration window). Save the database of pre-registration information, and copy the race project directory into the fsTimer directory on all of the computers being used at the registration table.
</ul>
In the next section we give detailed instructions of what the roles of people helping at the registration and finish line would be.<br><br>

<b>The day of the race: Setup</b>
<ul>
<li>Set up the finish line, with a table for the timing computer and cones and caution tape for a chute.
<li>Have finish line crew ready.
<li>Set up the registration tables, with each registration computer running fsTimer and open to the Registration window, with the preregistration database loaded.
<li>Have registration crew ready.
</ul>
In the next section we give details about how we like to set up the finish line.<br><br>

<b>The day of the race: Registration</b>
<ul>
<li>Make sure registration goes smoothly and that the people operating the registration computers are saving frequently.
<li>When registration has closed (maybe 15 minutes before the race starts), copy the final registration databases from each registration computer onto a flash drive. Copy them all from the flash drive onto the computer that will be used for marking times.
<li>On the timing computer, compile the registration databases.
<li>Take the timing computer to the finish line, and enter the Timing component of fsTimer to prepare for timing.
</ul>

<b>The day of the race: Timing</b>
<ul>
<li>Be on the phone with the person starting the race, and press "Start!" in fsTimer at the same moment that the race begins.
<li>Ensure that the finish line crew are marking times and tracking bib IDs according to plan.
<li>Save the results periodically.
<li>When the last runner has crossed the finish line, save the times and print the final results.
<li>Post the results, and it's finished!
</ul>
The procedure for operating the finish line can be very simple for small races (50 or fewer people), but for large races we have found a number of details that are very important for ensuring accurate results. These details are, of course, discussed in the next section.<br><br>
